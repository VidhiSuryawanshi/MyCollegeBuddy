                alert("⚠️ Cyber Reminder!\n\nCybersecurity isn’t just about firewalls and encryption. It’s about trust, ethics, and protecting lives online. Your actions matter — every single time.");
            </script>
            <h2>1️⃣ What is Cyber Security?</h2>
            <p>
                Cyber Security is the art and science of defending digital systems from unauthorized access, attacks, or damage. It includes protecting your personal data, safeguarding corporate infrastructure, and securing governments from cyber warfare. Every time
                you log in, share a file, or enter a password — you're part of the digital ecosystem that needs protection.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>🔍 Ethical Hacking:</strong> Ethical hackers simulate real attacks to find vulnerabilities before malicious hackers do. They use tools like Kali Linux, Metasploit, Burp Suite, Nmap, and John the Ripper to test systems.</li>
                <li><strong>🌐 Network Security:</strong> Focuses on protecting data during transmission and preventing unauthorized access via firewalls, IDS/IPS, proxies, and secure communication protocols (SSL/TLS, HTTPS).</li>
                <li><strong>🧩 Application Security:</strong> Ensures the code you write is resilient to threats such as SQL Injection, Cross-site Scripting (XSS), Insecure Deserialization, and improper authentication mechanisms.</li>
                <li><strong>📁 Information Security:</strong> Focuses on confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA triad) of data, both at rest and in motion.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                In short , Cyber Security isn’t just a profession — it’s a responsibility to uphold digital trust in every aspect of modern life.

            <h2>3️⃣ Where Should You Begin?</h2>
            <p>
                Starting in cybersecurity may feel overwhelming due to its broad scope — but a structured roadmap can make it smooth. Begin with the foundations, and layer your knowledge gradually.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>🌐 Computer Networking:</strong> Understand how data travels across the internet. Learn concepts like IP addressing, MAC, TCP/IP model, DNS, ARP, NAT, and HTTP/HTTPS.</li>
                <li><strong>🐧 Linux Essentials:</strong> Linux is the preferred OS for security tools. Learn basic shell commands, directory navigation, scripting, file permissions, and network troubleshooting.</li>
                <li><strong>🔒 Cryptography:</strong> Explore how data is kept secure using encryption (AES, RSA), hashing (SHA, MD5), digital signatures, and public-key infrastructure (PKI).</li>
                <li><strong>📜 Cyber Ethics & Law:</strong> Learn legal frameworks like the IT Act (India), GDPR (Europe), and global best practices that define ethical vs malicious hacking.</li>
            </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>✅ <strong>Always Hack Ethically:</strong> Use legal platforms like TryHackMe, HackTheBox, or your own lab environments.</li>
                    <li>✅ <strong>Master the Fundamentals:</strong> Don’t jump straight into hacking tools — understand networking and OS basics first.</li>
                    <li>✅ <strong>Practice Consistently:</strong> Daily practice beats binge learning. Even 30 minutes a day makes a difference.</li>
                    <li>✅ <strong>Build a Portfolio:</strong> Create GitHub repos, write blogs, or share CTF solutions to showcase your skills.</li>
                    <li>✅ <strong>Join the Community:</strong> Attend webinars, Discord servers, LinkedIn groups, and local meetups.</li>
