            <h2>💡 What is Design / UX?</h2>
            <p>Design isn’t just how something looks — it’s how it works . Good UX (User Experience) ensures a product is intuitive, beautiful, and delightful to use. As someone who has worked across dozens of products and teams, I’ve learned that design
                is about solving problems creatively with the user at the center.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>UI/UX Design & Branding:</strong> Crafting not only the interface but the personality and tone of the product.</li>
                <li><strong>Human-Centered Design:</strong> You design for people — understanding their needs, behaviors, and emotions.</li>
                <li><strong>Experience Design:</strong> From the first tap to the final checkout — the journey should be smooth, clear, and engaging.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>🚀 Why Choose Design / UX?</h2>
            <p>If you’re someone who notices the smallest detail, questions confusing interfaces, or loves expressing creativity visually — this field is for you. It’s not just about pretty pixels. It’s about crafting experiences that feel natural and useful.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Creative Expression:</strong> You get to solve logic problems visually. That’s the sweet spot.</li>
                <li><strong>Storytelling Through Design:</strong> Every product tells a story. Designers are the authors of how that story is felt.</li>
                <li><strong>Team Collaboration:</strong> You work with developers, marketers, product managers. Design is the bridge between vision and execution.</li>
                <li><strong>High Demand:</strong> Startups, SaaS companies, global brands — everyone needs designers who understand users.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>🛣️ Roadmap to Becoming a Designer</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Design Principles:</strong> Learn color theory, spacing, typography, visual hierarchy. These are the ABCs of design.</li>
                <li><strong>Tools of the Trade:</strong> Start with <strong>Figma</strong> — it’s powerful and beginner-friendly. Then explore Adobe XD, Photoshop for visual work.</li>
                <li><strong>UX Process:</strong> Research → Wireframing → Prototyping → Testing. This is how real-world design happens.</li>
                <li><strong>UI Research:</strong> Analyze well-designed apps. Try redesigning something broken — it teaches you more than a course.</li>
                <li><strong>Real Projects:</strong> Nothing teaches like doing. Start your portfolio early and iterate constantly.</li>
            </ul>
