                alert("🚨 CP Reminder!\n\nCompetitive Programming isn’t about being a genius — it’s about being consistent.\nEven 1 question a day > 0 questions a week.\nStay steady. Grow daily. 💪");
            </script>

            <h2>1️⃣ What is Competitive Programming (CP)? 💻</h2>
            <p>
                Think of CP as a mental sport where you solve real-world problems using code — but with a twist: time and memory limits. You're not just writing correct code — you're writing efficient, optimized solutions under pressure. Sounds simple? Try solving one
                under a 2-second limit!
            </p>

            <ul style="line-height: 1.8;">
                <li>🎯 <strong>Problem Solving:</strong> You're given a situation — you write logic to solve it with precision.</li>
                <li>💡 <strong>Foundation of DSA:</strong> CP builds your skills in arrays, strings, recursion, DP, graphs, and beyond.</li>
                <li>🏆 <strong>Global Competition:</strong> Compete on platforms like <strong>Codeforces</strong>, <strong>LeetCode</strong>, <strong>AtCoder</strong>, <strong>CodeChef</strong> and see how you rank worldwide.</li>
                <li>🚀 <strong>Career Boost:</strong> Most tech companies — from startups to MAANG — love hiring CP champs.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>2️⃣ Why Choose CP / DSA? 🧠</h2>
            <p>
                Still wondering why CP is worth your time? Just ask anyone who cracked companies like <strong>Infosys, TCS, Amazon, or Google</strong> — CP was their secret weapon. It’s not just about coding — it’s about transforming your thinking.
            </p>

            <ul style="line-height: 1.8;">
                <li>⚡ <strong>Mental Gym:</strong> CP sharpens your brain like a workout — logic, speed, and precision all in one.</li>
                <li>🎯 <strong>Interview Ready:</strong> CP trains you to think fast, debug smarter, and handle tough coding rounds with ease.</li>
                <li>⏱️ <strong>Speed Boost:</strong> In real-world interviews, solving questions quickly = more chances to impress.</li>
                <li>🧠 <strong>Deep Learning:</strong> You’ll master concepts like time complexity, edge cases, and optimized algorithms.</li>
                <li>🌍 <strong>Global Community:</strong> You’ll join a worldwide community of coders, mentors, and future friends.</li>
            </ul>

            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                💡 <strong>Bonus Insight:</strong> CP is more than preparation — it’s a mindset. It teaches you how to stay calm, break down problems, and think like an engineer.

                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>🚀 Step 5: Practice Smart on Top Platforms</strong> — 💻
                    <br><span>Solve problems on <strong>LeetCode</strong> (start easy → hard), <strong>Codeforces</strong> (for contests and ratings), and <strong>AtCoder</strong> (for logic-building). Track your progress and stick to one sheet initially.</span>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>📝 Step 6: Build Your CP Resume</strong> — 💼
                    <br><span>Showcase your journey: Add your Codeforces/LeetCode rating, upload your GitHub solutions, maintain a public DSA journal or Notion page, and share your insights on LinkedIn.</span>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">

            <h2>8️⃣ Senior Tips — Learn From Those Who've Cracked It 🔥</h2>
            <p>
                These aren't just tips — they’re golden habits shared by seniors who have aced tech interviews and competitive programming contests. If you're serious about cracking Infosys, TCS, Google, or any top tech company — absorb these like gospel. 📘
            </p>

            <ul style="line-height: 1.8;">
                <li>✅ <strong>Practice 1–2 problems daily</strong> — Even on your worst days. Consistency > Motivation. One quality question a day builds compounding logic.</li>

                <li>✅ <strong>Quality beats quantity</strong> — It’s not about solving 1000+ problems, it’s about deeply understanding each pattern, time complexity, and edge case.</li>

                <li>✅ <strong>Maintain a DSA journal</strong> — Write down problem summaries, your logic, time-space analysis, and mistakes. Your future self will thank you.</li>

                <li>✅ <strong>Have a revision day weekly</strong> — Pick one day to go back and revisit old problems. It boosts retention and reinforces learning like magic.</li>

                <li>❌ <strong>Never copy-paste solutions</strong> — Understand the "why" behind every line. Real growth comes from struggling, not shortcutting.</li>

                <li>❌ <strong>Don't fear “Hard” problems</strong> — The tag only means “more thinking”. Break the problem down into smaller steps. You’ll get there.</li>

                <li>✅ <strong>Join coding contests</strong> — Even if you come last, you’ll learn more in 2 hours than you would in 2 weeks of passive practice.</li>

                <li>✅ <strong>Build your coding network</strong> — Follow mentors on LinkedIn, contribute on GitHub, join Discord/Telegram groups. Community = growth.</li>
            </ul>

            <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
                💡 <strong>Remember:</strong> Progress is not always visible — but it’s happening. Stay consistent, stay humble, and trust the process. The road to DSA mastery is not easy, but it's absolutely worth it. 💪
