    <!-- Section 1: Common Mistakes -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>💡 Mistakes Most Students Make (But You Can Avoid)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Waiting till the last semester to start coding or preparing for placements. Start early — even in 2nd year!</li>
            <li>Just mugging up theory instead of doing hands-on practice. No one is asking you to recite definitions in interviews.</li>
            <li>Being too focused on CGPA. Yes, grades matter — but not more than your projects, problem-solving, and confidence.</li>
            <li>Making resumes look flashy but adding nothing genuine. Trust me, interviewers can tell if your resume is just decoration.</li>
            <li>Thinking “DSA is only for big companies”. Nope — it builds logic, and that’s needed everywhere.</li>
            <li>Stressing too much. Placement season is tough, but don’t compare yourself. Everyone’s journey is different.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>🗣️ Advice from Seniors Who’ve Been There</h2>

        <div class="advice-card">
            <h3>Ritika Sharma (Final Year, CSE)</h3>
            <p>“I used to think I wasn’t smart enough for product-based companies. But I started solving 1 DSA problem daily, and it built my confidence. You don’t need 10 projects, you need 2 that you understand well.”</p>
        </div>

        <div class="advice-card">
            <h3>Aditya Mehta (3rd Year, CSE)</h3>
            <p>“If you’re an introvert, don’t worry — you don’t need to talk a lot to stand out. Just start participating in coding contests, post on LinkedIn about your learning, and reach out to seniors for help. Most of us want to help juniors — just
                ask sincerely. Also, don’t fake things on your resume — if you haven’t done ML, don’t write ‘Python ML Expert’. Keep it real.”</p>
        </div>

        <div class="advice-card">
            <h3>Simran Kaur (Final Year, IT)</h3>
            <p>“Don’t ignore aptitude. I know it sounds boring, but if you’re aiming for companies like Infosys, Wipro, Capgemini — aptitude + communication can get you the offer even if you’re average in coding. Also, during interviews, stay calm. Even
                if you get stuck , don’t panic — just explain your thought process. They judge how you think, not how fast you type.”</p>
