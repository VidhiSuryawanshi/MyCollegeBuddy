        <h2>💡 Mistakes Most Students Make (But You Can Avoid)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Waiting till the last semester to start coding or preparing for placements. Start early — even in 2nd year! Trust me, even solving one problem daily or building small projects consistently will compound over time.</li>
            <li>Just mugging up theory instead of doing hands-on practice. Projects, debugging, errors — that's how real learning happens. Interviews test logic and problem-solving, not textbook memory.</li>
            <li>Being too focused on CGPA. Yes, it’s important — but recruiters also care about your practical skills, communication, and ability to solve real problems. Balance both!</li>
            <li>Making resumes look flashy but adding nothing genuine. If you’ve built a basic calculator but write “engineered dynamic computation system” — it’s obvious. Be honest and explain your work well.</li>
            <li>Thinking “DSA is only for big companies”. Even service-based companies ask logic-based questions. DSA isn’t just for Amazon or Google — it's a mindset booster.</li>
            <li>Stressing too much. Placement season is tough, yes. But comparison is poison. Some get in early, some late — both paths are okay. Keep learning and believe in your timing.</li>
            <li>Not networking. Just one message to a senior can change your prep game. Don’t hesitate to reach out, ask for tips, and stay connected.</li>
            <li>Ignoring communication skills. Even if you're a coding champ, if you can't explain your thought process clearly, you may lose the edge.</li>
            <li>Copy-pasting projects from GitHub. You’ll be stuck in interviews. Build small, simple things, but build them yourself — that’s what counts.</li>
            <li>Neglecting mental health. Binge-coding, skipping sleep, and constant anxiety won’t help. Take breaks. Your mind is your best tool — keep it healthy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>🗣️ Advice from Seniors Who’ve Been There</h2>

        <div class="advice-card">
            <h3>Ritika Sharma (Final Year, CSE)</h3>
            <p>“I used to think I wasn’t smart enough for product-based companies. But I started solving 1 DSA problem daily, and it built my confidence. You don’t need 10 projects, you need 2 that you understand well. Also, take your resume seriously —
                it’s your story on paper. And please, practice explaining your projects aloud before interviews.”</p>
        </div>

        <div class="advice-card">
            <h3>Aditya Mehta (3rd Year, CSE)</h3>
            <p>“If you’re an introvert, don’t worry — you don’t need to talk a lot to stand out. Just start participating in coding contests, post on LinkedIn about your learning, and reach out to seniors for help. Most of us want to help juniors — just
                ask sincerely. Also, don’t fake things on your resume — if you haven’t done ML, don’t write ‘Python ML Expert’. Keep it real.”</p>
            <p>“Also, keep a small journal of your progress. It helps you stay accountable and gives you motivation when you look back.”</p>
        </div>

        <div class="advice-card">
            <h3>Simran Kaur (Final Year, IT)</h3>
            <p>“Don’t ignore aptitude. I know it sounds boring, but if you’re aiming for companies like Infosys, Wipro, Capgemini — aptitude + communication can get you the offer even if you’re average in coding. Also, during interviews, stay calm. Even
                if you get stuck , don’t panic — just explain your thought process. They judge how you think, not how fast you type.”</p>
            <p>“One more thing — take part in college hackathons and fests. They teach teamwork, time pressure, and give you memories too. Those moments will stay with you.”</p>
        </div>

        <div class="advice-card">
            <h3>Rahul Verma (Placed at Accenture)</h3>
            <p>“I was never a topper, but I practiced regularly. I watched free YouTube playlists and took notes. I didn’t just consume content — I implemented it. Consistency wins. Also, be kind to your batchmates — the tech world is small, and you’ll cross
                paths again.”</p>
        </div>

        <div class="advice-card">
            <h3>Priya Sinha (Placed at TCS)</h3>
            <p>“Soft skills helped me crack HR interviews. Read a little English daily, speak to friends in English, and watch interviews online. Prepare answers to questions like ‘Tell me about yourself’ and ‘Why should we hire you?’ Don’t sound like a
                robot — be real, smile, and speak from the heart.”</p>
